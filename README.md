# serviceRecordAnalysis

This is NLP analysis used to analyze customer service and customer service records.
It is divided into two major items. 
The first item is sentiment analysis, which can know what customers are dissatisfied with and the service level of each customer service.
The second item is to retrieve keywords and know competitive product information and market information.
Because the content involves company secrets, we cannot post the data and execution results.
